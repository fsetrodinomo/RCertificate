## input$var vs. output$plot
Input$var:
  -Created by input widgets or controls
  - Some HTMLwidgets also spawn input$click_etc variabls

Output$plot
  - Created @server.R to render content to be sent to the client server
  

## Getting the ui.R file right
Never include 
- input variables e.g input$var
- naked output variables such as output$plot

instead:
Always quote the names of variables, preferably in double quotation marks-- e.g. ("plot")

## Getting the server.R file right
- Added new content to display to the output object with an assignment:
    output$curve_plot <-
- Choose the appropriate render*()function for the content which needed to be send to the client side
- Access input values from the input object via their name, e.g. input$var
