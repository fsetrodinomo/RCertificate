Uploading files into Shiny apps
- use fileInput("uploaded_file") in the ui.R
- in server.R read in the file contents using:
  input$uploaded_file$datapath
- Uploaded files will be created in a temporary folder and will be deleted when the user leaves the app


ui.r
@navbar
   column(fileInput("uploaded_time_tracker",
                         label="Upload your data"),
               width = 6)
      ),

//Renderplot at the analyzed data
  
  output$time_tracker_summary <-renderPlot({
  
  input$analyse_data

    uploaded_time tracker <-isolate(upload_time_tracker())
    
    uploaded_time_tracker %>%
      group_by(`project name`) %>%
      summarise(total_hours = sum(`hours worked`)) %>%
       ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(`project name`, total_hours),
                  y = total_hours)) +
       geom_col() +
       labs(x = "",
            y = "Total Hours Worked") +
       theme_minimal() +
       coord_flip()      
      })
