1. Debugging R code
- columns in a dataset are incorrectly formatted
- input variables are incorrectly formatted
- reactive variables updating in the wrong order or are not being updated at all

debugging steps:
  . use print() to send variables/data to the console
  . use shinyjs::runcodeUI() & shinyjs::runcodeServer() to interactively explore R variables in your shiny app
  . use shiny::reactlog for issues with reactivity
  
2. Debugging web content
-content overlapping with other pages elements
-htmlwidgets not displaying data as expected, especially misbehaving toolstips

debugging steps:
  . browsers inspector
  . use shiny::reactlog to send js messages to the R console consider using along side runcodeUI() and runcodeServer()
  
3. Debugging deploy issuess
- App fails to load

debugging steps
  . check appropriate packages loaded
  . file paths MUST be relative to Shiny directory
  . include all code in the server or use:
      source("data-processing.R",local=TRUE)
  . check different time zones
  . Using api's ? Ensure tokens are sent to the server
