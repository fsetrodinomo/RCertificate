## Single vs Multiple files
shiny app -> single file use shinyapp(snippet)

Disadvantages single file app:
  - Apps quickly become unwiedly and difficult to manage
  - It's important to keep mental seperation between what exists in the UI and server components of the app(seperations of concerns,cs)
  - There can be issues in deploying Shiny apps that have been developed in a single file

NOTE:
- Single app are ONLY useful for small examples

 

## server.R
- input and output arguments are mandatory
- easier to include session by default than debug errors

## ui.R
- navbarPage() is a specific page layout; there are many others available
- fluidPage() creates a single-page app
- defines the user experience, client side of the app


## server.R
Structure:
- Able to run code(only file which makes this possible)
- Contains your data wrangling, modeling and data visualization code


Include:
- Input widgets
- custom HTML/CSS/JS files
- Packages including own HTML/JS must be loaded in server.R AND ui.R 
e.g. HTML widgets

CAN'T be done in ui.R
- Charts,plots and other output cannot be created in the ui.R 
  -> MUST be first rendered in the server.R 
      file.
- Directly access values from input widgets
  -> Cross-dependency must be specified in 
      the server.R file

Input widgets:
- Achieved by server-side with :
    updateSelectInput()
- Desirable to prevent users from seeing   
  empty charts or tables throught 
  Interdependent controls achieved by:
    update*Input()
