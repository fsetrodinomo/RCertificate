shiny app -> single file use shinyapp(snippet)

Disadvantages single file app:
  - Apps quickly become unwiedly and difficult to manage
  - It's important to keep mental seperation between what exists in the UI and server components of the app(seperations of concerns,cs)
  - There can be issues in deploying Shiny apps that have been developed in a single file

NOTE:
- Single app are ONLY useful for small examples
